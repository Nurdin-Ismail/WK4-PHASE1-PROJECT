# WK4-PHASE1-PROJECT

# Author: NURDIN ABDIWAHAB ISMAIL

## Phase 1 Project:
For this project, I'm going to build a Single Page Application (SPA). My frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.

### Project Description:

This is meant to be a book recomendation site. I use the OpenLibrary public API and fetch the book contents of whatever genre is clicked. 

There are buttons that help you choose whether you want the up and coming, best rated or random books to be displayed once you click them.

The genres are limited to the most popular among both Fiction and Non-Fiction.

#### Core Delivarables:

The app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. (Alternatively use an Array)

The entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

The app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

#### All Core Deliverables Met:

1. Only HTML, CSS and JS

2. Only a single HTMl file

3. Oly 2 event listeners, because the entire project is based off of click events and I'm unable to make post and patch requests to the publick api.

4. Rating for Books
